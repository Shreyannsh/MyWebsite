    <p> you may need courage in the workplace – whether today or in future – include giving feedback, and being
        clear on your expectations about equity – whether this is about recognition, promotion, or a pay increase.
        You may need courage to ask for help. Brené Brown’s research with 150 c-suite leaders uncovered that leaders
        will delegate critical work to those who have asked for help in the past, because they trust that these same
        people will ask for help again should they need, if they are stretched too far. You may need courage to
        ask for a performance review; to express a mental health need; to ask for a career break; to make the
        decision to not be tied to a role that doesn’t enable you to be your best self; to own your strengths
        and what you have to offer your role, your team and your workplace.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center; margin:2rem;">The benefits of courage</h1>

    <p>So, what do we get in return for being courageous? A review of the literature shows that for individuals,
        courage is associated with increased positive energy and self-confidence, and improved motivation; increased
        accountability, resourcefulness and goal attainment; greater empathy, conscientiousness
        and prosocial orientation. We know that we are inspired to courage by observing the courageous acts
        of others and upon reflecting on our own courageous acts. There is a direct correlation between
        demonstrating courage and our psychological wellbeing. As Robert Biswas-Diener says, “Courage enables
        individuals to live a full life.”</p>
