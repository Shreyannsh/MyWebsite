    <h1> “If we are not fully ourselves, truly in the present moment, we miss everything.” ~Thich Nhat Hanh</h1>

    <p> Meditation is a mental and physical course of action that a person uses to separate themselves 
        from their thoughts and feelings in order to become fully aware. It plays a part in virtually
         all religions although some don't use the word 'meditation' to describe their particular 
         meditative or contemplative practice. Meditation does not always have a religious element. 
         It is a natural part of the human experience and is increasingly used as a therapy for 
         promoting good health and boosting the immune system. Anyone who has looked at a sunset or
          a beautiful painting and felt calm and inner joy, while their mind becomes clear and their
           perception sharpens, has had a taste of the realm of meditation. Successful meditation means
            simply being - not judging, not thinking, just being aware, at peace and living each moment
             as it unfolds. Meditation should be a part of daily routine for every being by understanding
              the perception of awareness and implementing that while carrying any action.</p>
