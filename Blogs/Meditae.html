    <h1> “If we are not fully ourselves, truly in the present moment, we miss everything.” ~Thich Nhat Hanh</h1>

    <p> Meditation is a mental and physical course of action that a person uses to separate themselves from their thoughts and feelings in order to become fully aware.

    It plays a part in virtually all religions although some don't use the word 'meditation' to describe their particular meditative or contemplative practice.
    
    Meditation does not always have a religious element. It is a natural part of the human experience and is increasingly used as a therapy for promoting good health and boosting the immune system.
    
    Anyone who has looked at a sunset or a beautiful painting and felt calm and inner joy, while their mind becomes clear and their perception sharpens, has had a taste of the realm of meditation.
    
    Successful meditation means simply being - not judging, not thinking, just being aware, at peace and living each moment as it unfolds.</p>
    
    <h3><span style="color:var(--primary-color)"> 5 Ways to Incorporate Mindfulness into Your Daily Routine </span></h3>

    <ol class="list-non-bullet">
        <li>
            1. Notice, don’t think.
            <p> Pretend you are a traveler or student encountering this activity for the very first time. Don’t judge,
                label, and think about what you’re doing. Just notice. Notice every detail with an open, beginner’s
                mind.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            2. When in doubt, check your breathing.
            <p>If you feel your thoughts wandering from the present task, take a minute to hear and feel yourself breathe.
            Just paying attention to a few breaths will bring you back to the present moment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            3. You have five senses, use them.
           <p>Mindfulness means truly experiencing what is going on right now. This is more than just noticing what
            something looks like. What does it smell like? Feel it with your hands. What is the texture? Temperature?
            What do you hear?<p>
        </li>
        <li>
            4. Have a strategy to handle nagging thoughts.
           <p>Occasionally we all have thoughts that won’t go away—so you need a strategy for how to handle them. I like
            to have a notebook with me at all times to write any nagging to-dos, ideas or issues. If you write them
            down, your mind can relax because it knows you can go back to them later.<p>
        </li>
        <li>
            5. It is what it is.
            <p>You don’t need to analyze your mindfulness experience. Don’t worry about what it all means or if you’re
            being mindful enough. Just try to be mindful every day. Come more fully into the present moment. Let the
            experience be what it is.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div>
        While this might not fit the ideal of a perfect, solitary meditation practice, it works for me. It works because
        it
        gets me to the right place—the present moment.
    </div>

    <p>Every week when I make bread, I re-discover that by mixing, kneading, and baking, I am able to come more fully into
    the present moment and really connect with life. And isn’t that the purpose of a meditation practice in the first
    place?</p>
